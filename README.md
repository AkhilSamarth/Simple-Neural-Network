# Simple-Neural-Network

A basic neural network with a variable number of layers and nodes.

I created this to gain some exposure to machine learning and see how it works. I was able to use this script to create a neural network that could recognize and classify images of handwritten digits.

Created with heavy help from the YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown and his series on neural networks.
